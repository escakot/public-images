### Contents
1. Architectural Plan:

2. Application Modules:
    * Core Components
    * User Interfaces
    * Database Layer
    * Business Logic
    * APIs and Connections
3. Transactions and User Flows:
    * List all the parties/users/systems involved
    * Define all the steps of the process while clearly establishing ownership and responsibilities
    * Make sure the criteria for movement between the steps is clear as well (inputs, outputs, tasks to be completed in between stages)
    * Captures the userâ€™s expectations of how they intend to operate the system (Is the user a customer? Or a developer?)
